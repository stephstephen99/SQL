# Stephen Greenes SQL Portfolio

"Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions." If you want to format the text a certain way, you can check out the styling guide in this documentation. You can click on Preview (the tab at the top of the workbook) to see how your formatting will look. Take a look at the screenshots below to see what I did with mine and how it turned out.
If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to email me at stephstephen99@gmail.com
